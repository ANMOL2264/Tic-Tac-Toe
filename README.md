# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows the user to play against the CPU or the system.

## Contents

### index.html

- It is the initial file where the player can choose their symbol ('x' or 'o') to play with.
- The symbol chosen by the player is then transferred to the second page, where the main game takes place.

### Second.html

- It consists of the grid where the game will be played. The user can click on the desired cell to make their move.
- The flow of the game is indicated by messages displayed below the grid. Additionally, it includes a scoring system that keeps track of the number of games won by the player and the CPU.
- After each game result, the player is given the option to start a new round, which begins a new game with the previously chosen symbol and maintains the scores, or reset the game which allows the player to select their symbol again and start a new game with a score of 0.

### CSS Stylesheets (CSS_First.css & CSS_Second.css)

-  Two CSS files are included to enhance the visual presentation and styling of each web page.
